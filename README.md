###About
    
reaPyr utilizes the pytsk3 framework to carve off of a specified
disk image the credential hashes for Windows, Mozilla, Chrome, and
various other accounts.  The purpose of this software is to aid in
investigations in which one may not have access to account credentials.

The hope being that as many often use the same account credentials
for multiple accounts, if we can glean one set of credentials we
may be able to unlock other accounts as well using the same credential
sets.


###Usage

```bash
user@system:~$ reaPyr.py [-h] -d DISKNAME [-o OFFSET] [-ss SECTSIZE]

This program carves, or reaps, user credentials from a specified disk image.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d DISKNAME, --diskname DISKNAME
                        Name of the disk image to reap.
  -o OFFSET, --offset OFFSET
                        Offset into disk where OS resides. Default is 0.
  -ss SECTSIZE, --sectsize SECTSIZE
                        Sector size of OS. Default is 512 bytes.
```

###TODO
* Think about deleting ./disk_rec/ after each reap
* Think about aggregating harvest files to central_harvest in main dir
* Add IE Harvesting Support
* Add FF Harvesting Support
* Add Chrome Harvesting Support
* Add IM Harvesting Support

###Future Work
* Add support for running on multiple OS
* Add reapers for multiple OS
